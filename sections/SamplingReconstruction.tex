\subsection{Digital Signals}
\subsubsection{Sampling Theorem}
Sampling means that the analog signal is periodically measured with a sampling interval T. The discrete index $n$, relates to
the time $t$ as follows:
\[ t = nT \qquad n = 0,1,2,\ldots \]
The sampling frequency relates to the sampling interval as follows:
\[ f_s = \frac{1}{T} \]
Sampling Theorem (Nyquist rate):
\[ f_s \geq 2f_{max} \qquad \text{or} \qquad T \leq \frac{1}{2f_{max}} \]
Nyquist interval:
\[ \left[-\frac{f_s}{2}, \frac{f_s}{2}\right] \]

The spectrum $X(f)$ of the sampled signal will be replicated
\[ \hat{X}(f) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}X(f-m f_s)\]


\subsubsection{Flat-top sampling}
In practical sampling each sample is held for a short period of time ($\tau$).
\[ x_{flat}(t) =  \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}x(nT)p(t - nT) ~~~ p(t) \text{: flat-top pulse with duration } \tau \]

This is equivalent to filtering the perfectly sampled signal $\hat{x}$ with a linear filter with the impulse response $p(t)$.
The spectrum of the filter looks like this
\[ |P(f)| = \tau \left| \frac{sin(\pi f \tau)}{\pi f \tau} \right| \]
% TODO maybe add plot

\subsubsection{Aliasing}
If the signal frequency $f$ is outside the nyquist interval, the signal will be
aliased with $f - f_{sampling}$.\\
\textbf{Example:} $sin(8\pi t)$ (signal frequency $f=4$) sampled at a rate of
$f_s=5Hz$ will be aliased to $sin(2\pi (f-f_s) t) = sin(2\pi (-1) t)$\\

Is the signal frequency $f$ inside the nyquist interval, no aliasing will be
perceived.

The stop frequency from the Antialiasing Prefilter is defined as:
\[ f_{stop} = f_s - f_{pass} \]
The attenuation of the Antialiasing Prefilter is:

\[ A(f) = -20 \cdot \log_{10}{\left|\frac{H(f)}{H(f_0)}\right|} \]
